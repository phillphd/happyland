overview: 'I spent the last half of my 20''s working my way up through the ranks at an agency. But when I reached my (very safe) career goals before the age of 30, I found myself asking "Is this really all there is?" So, in 2018, at 8 and a half months pregnant, I left my job as a Creative Director to become a mother and open the doors to my own studio â€“ and I''ve never looked back.'
